56.36	58.0	[0] thath
58.2	58.24	[0] so
58.68	58.8	[0] they
58.96	59.44	[0] originally
59.72	59.84	[0] they
60.0	60.36	[0] decided

67.32	67.48	[0] they'll
67.52	67.64	[0] say
67.68	67.84	[0] there's
67.88	67.96	[0] no
68.04	68.2	[0] such
68.24	68.44	[0] thing
69.08	69.2	[0] i'
69.32	69.52	[0] lovet
69.56	69.76	[0] youar
69.8	70.04	[0] people
70.08	70.12	[0] that
70.24	70.36	[0] are
70.4	70.44	[0] not
70.68	71.08	[0] linguists
71.24	71.28	[0] or
71.4	71.8	[0] engineer
72.04	72.16	[0] right
73.08	73.24	[0] these
73.28	73.4	[0] are
73.44	73.64	[0] both
73.8	74.0	[0] weir
75.96	76.04	[0] right
76.4	76.48	[0] they
76.52	76.68	[0] need
76.72	76.76	[0] a
76.88	77.2	[0] writer
77.28	77.8	[0] samping
83.84	83.88	[0] the
83.92	84.16	[0] problem
84.2	84.24	[0] with
84.4	84.88	[0] engineers
85.0	85.04	[0] is
85.16	85.2	[0] b
87.8	87.92	[0] they
88.0	88.2	[0] make
88.2	88.44	[0] funny
88.48	89.68	[0] soundsther
91.68	91.72	[0] that
91.88	91.92	[0] we
92.28	92.44	[0] talk
92.52	92.76	[0] about
92.88	92.92	[0] is
93.0	93.2	[0] give
93.28	93.48	[0] them
93.84	93.88	[0] for
94.16	94.2	[0] an
94.24	95.32	[0] extrae
95.84	96.0	[0] give
96.04	96.24	[0] them
96.28	96.32	[0] so
96.6	96.76	[0] if
96.92	97.04	[0] they
97.12	97.32	[0] want
97.72	98.6	[0] basicallydi
99.0	99.04	[0] i
99.08	99.36	[0] thought
99.4	99.44	[0] that
99.6	99.64	[0] was
99.84	99.88	[0] i
99.96	100.2	[0] thought
100.24	100.28	[0] he
100.36	100.56	[0] meant
100.64	100.84	[0] give
100.92	101.08	[0] them
101.12	101.16	[0] a
101.28	101.52	[0] music
101.6	101.84	[0] cd
101.96	103.52	[0] liked
103.68	103.72	[0] that
103.84	103.88	[0] of
103.92	104.08	[0] their
104.12	104.44	[0] speech
104.48	104.52	[0] and
104.56	104.6	[0] i
104.6	104.8	[0] guess
104.8	104.84	[0] it
104.96	105.4	[0] depends
105.44	105.48	[0] on
105.6	105.64	[0] what
105.8	106.2	[0] audience
106.24	106.4	[0] you're
106.44	106.68	[0] talking
106.72	106.76	[0] to
107.52	107.56	[0] you
107.68	107.72	[0] know
107.76	107.8	[0] i
107.92	108.32	[0] personally
108.36	108.4	[0] would
108.64	108.68	[0] not
108.76	108.96	[0] want
109.0	109.04	[0] to
109.12	109.36	[0] see
109.88	109.92	[0] i
110.12	110.4	[0] meeting
110.52	110.56	[0] but
111.12	111.44	[0] maybe
112.0	112.12	[0] if
112.16	112.32	[0] you're
112.32	112.56	[0] having
112.6	112.64	[0] some
112.8	113.12	[0] planning
113.16	113.44	[0] meeting
113.48	113.52	[0] of

113.84	114.12	[0] sort
115.48	115.52	[0] y
115.6	115.76	[0] fun
116.12	116.16	[0] i
116.6	116.76	[0] just
116.76	116.8	[0] be
116.88	117.0	[0] fun
117.08	117.12	[0] you
117.2	117.24	[0] know
117.28	117.36	[0] if
117.4	117.64	[0] nothing
117.68	117.84	[0] else
117.92	117.96	[0] you
118.08	118.12	[0] know
118.32	118.36	[0] but
118.48	118.52	[0] it
118.64	118.88	[0] also
119.16	119.2	[0] i
119.92	119.96	[0] it
120.08	120.28	[0] also
120.32	120.36	[0] i
120.4	120.56	[0] think
120.64	120.96	[0] builds
121.04	121.12	[0] up
121.16	121.48	[0] towards
121.52	121.56	[0] the
121.6	121.8	[0] goal
122.0	122.2	[0] saying
122.28	122.52	[0] look
122.56	122.6	[0] you
122.6	122.64	[0] know
122.72	122.88	[0] you're
122.88	123.04	[0] going
123.04	123.08	[0] to
123.12	123.24	[0] get
123.28	123.32	[0] this
123.44	123.48	[0] is
123.76	123.8	[0] is
123.84	123.88	[0] n
124.04	124.2	[0] need
124.28	124.36	[0] then
124.4	124.52	[0] you're
124.52	124.68	[0] going
124.68	124.72	[0] to
124.72	124.76	[0] go
124.84	125.04	[0] home
125.04	125.08	[0] with
125.16	125.2	[0] it
125.36	125.48	[0] it's
125.56	125.88	[0] actually
126.04	126.2	[0] it's
126.24	126.48	[0] probably
126.52	126.68	[0] going
126.68	126.72	[0] to
126.72	126.76	[0] be
126.76	127.04	[0] pretty
127.08	127.4	[0] useless
127.48	127.52	[0] to
127.76	127.8	[0] have
128.12	128.16	[0] but
128.24	128.28	[0] you
128.64	129.16	[0] appreciate
129.24	129.28	[0] you
129.32	129.36	[0] know
129.4	129.72	[0] where's
129.84	130.12	[0] useful
130.24	130.4	[0] where
130.44	130.56	[0] it's
130.68	131.04	[0] useless
131.52	131.56	[0] and
131.64	131.8	[0] then
131.92	132.08	[0] we're
132.12	132.28	[0] going
132.28	132.32	[0] to
132.32	132.36	[0] mo
132.56	132.6	[0] this
132.64	133.12	[0] technology
133.16	133.2	[0] so
133.32	133.36	[0] it
134.28	134.44	[0] now
134.52	134.56	[0] i
134.6	134.72	[0] think
134.76	134.88	[0] it'
136.4	136.44	[0] you
136.48	136.64	[0] mak
138.96	139.0	[0] the
139.04	139.6	[0] transcript
140.48	140.68	[0] oh
140.8	141.0	[0] yeah
141.44	141.6	[0] mean
141.76	142.0	[0] anyone
142.04	142.24	[0] can
142.28	142.32	[0] have
142.36	142.4	[0] the
142.44	143.04	[0] transcripts
143.24	143.28	[0] so
144.12	154.44	[0] iodin
155.0	155.16	[0] that's
155.2	155.24	[0] a
155.32	155.4	[0] very
155.4	155.56	[0] good
155.56	155.76	[0] point
155.76	155.8	[0] so
155.88	156.76	[0] we'resing
156.8	156.96	[0] clear
157.12	157.16	[0] the
157.16	158.6	[0] transcriptr
161.6	161.84	[0] sould
161.92	161.96	[0] be
162.04	162.08	[0] the
162.08	162.32	[0] same
162.36	162.4	[0] c
164.88	165.0	[0] right
165.2	165.6	[0] otherwise
165.72	165.92	[0] you're
165.92	165.96	[0] not
166.12	166.4	[0] allowed
166.68	166.72	[0] to
166.72	166.76	[0] go
166.92	167.08	[0] more
167.16	167.2	[0] like
167.28	167.44	[0] that's
167.52	167.64	[0] right
168.64	168.68	[0] so
168.72	168.96	[0] after
169.0	169.04	[0] the
