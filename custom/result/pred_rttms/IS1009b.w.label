205.2	205.48	[2] sall
205.84	205.88	[0] ight
206.0	206.24	[0] those
206.4	206.6	[2] which
206.68	206.72	[2] we
206.84	207.04	[2] get
207.2	207.4	[2] here
207.52	208.04	[2] nowadays
208.08	208.24	[0] it's
208.4	208.56	[0] very
208.68	208.88	[0] long
209.88	209.92	[2] and
210.88	210.92	[2] and
211.12	211.16	[2] it
211.24	211.52	[2] should
211.56	211.6	[2] have
211.76	212.48	[2] multipurpose
212.72	212.76	[2] like

213.92	214.24	[2] control
214.32	214.48	[2] which
214.52	214.56	[2] we
214.8	214.92	[2] use
215.0	215.04	[2] for
215.24	215.28	[2] t
215.44	215.48	[2] v
215.92	215.96	[2] it
216.08	216.36	[2] should
216.64	216.68	[2] it
216.76	217.04	[2] should
217.08	217.12	[2] be
217.28	217.44	[2] used
